This is the COVID-19 diagnosing visualization in Vision Transformer by our research: [A Vision Transformer Machine Learning Model for COVID-19 Dagnosis Using Chest X-Ray Images](https://github.com/TyBruceChen/Research-A-Fined-Tuned-ViT-for-COVID-19-Image-Auxiliary-Diagnosing/tree/main).

Specifically, I would like to thank Dr. Toby Hocking, who introduced and created the powerful [animint2](https://github.com/animint/animint2) R package.

The confidence of model's prediction has been added. Grad-CAM related images (origin/overlapped/heatmap/colormap) are displayed seperately.
